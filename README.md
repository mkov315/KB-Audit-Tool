# KB-Audit-Tool

Knowledge Base Audit Tool <br>
This tool is compatible with EBSCO's Holding Management package export and its purpose is twofold: <br>
    1. Output the unique package list (something EBSCO exports currently does not support) <br>
    2. Distill the export into a document only including relevant data so that the file side is manageable in Excel (currently the exports are too large for Excel to support). <br>
<br>
The fields chosen in this program are PackageName, PackageID, VendorName, VendorID, PackageType, IsCustom, HideOnPublicationFinder, and HideOnFullTextFinder. <br>
<br>
This tool will be used to aid in the CSU holdings audit process, but can be generalized for library institutions elsewhere. <br>
