# KB-Audit-Tool

Knowledge Base Audit Tool
This tool is compatible with EBSCO's Holding Management package export and its purpose is twofold:
    1. Output the unique package list (something EBSCO exports currently does not support)
    2. Distill the export into a document only including relevant data so that the file side is manageable in Excel (currently the exports are too large for Excel to support).

The fields chosen in this program are PackageName, PackageID, VendorName, VendorID, PackageType, IsCustom, HideOnPublicationFinder, and HideOnFullTextFinder.

This tool will be used to aid in the CSU holdings audit process, but can be generalized for library institutions elsewhere.
